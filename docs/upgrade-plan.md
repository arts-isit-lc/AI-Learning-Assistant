## 1. CDK CLI & Library (`cdk/package.json`)

### Problem
- `aws-cdk` CLI hard-pinned to `2.146.0` — causes the "Newer version of CDK is available" message on every deploy
- `aws-cdk` `2.142.0–2.148.0` has a known CVE: RestApi not generating `authorizationScope` correctly ([GHSA-qj85-69xf-2vxq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qj85-69xf-2vxq))
- `aws-cdk-lib` resolves to `2.219.0`, latest is `2.249.0`
- `@aws-cdk/aws-amplify-alpha` pinned to `2.146.0-alpha.0` (latest: `2.249.0-alpha.0`)
- `@aws-cdk/aws-appsync-alpha` pinned to `2.59.0-alpha.0` — significantly behind and mismatched. Only used in `amplify-stack.ts`

### Action
Update `cdk/package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "aws-cdk": "2.249.0",
  "@types/node": "^24.0.0"
},
"dependencies": {
  "@aws-cdk/aws-amplify-alpha": "2.249.0-alpha.0",
  "@aws-cdk/aws-appsync-alpha": "2.249.0-alpha.0",
  "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.249.0"
}
```

> ⚠️ `aws-appsync-alpha` is a large jump (`2.59.0` → `2.249.0`). Review the [changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-appsync-alpha/CHANGELOG.md) for breaking API changes. Run `cdk diff` after upgrading.

```bash
cd cdk && npm install
```

---

## 2. Lambda Runtimes

### Node.js Lambdas — `NODEJS_20_X` (13 functions)
All Node.js Lambda functions in `api-gateway-stack.ts` use `Runtime.NODEJS_20_X`. Node 20 is currently in maintenance mode. Node 22 is the current active LTS on Lambda.

Affected functions: `studentFunction`, `instructorFunction`, `adminFunction`, `preSignupLambda`, `addStudentOnSignUp`, `adjustUserRoles`, `adminLambdaAuthorizer`, `studentLambdaAuthorizer`, `instructorLambdaAuthorizer`, `AuthHandler`, `sqsFunction`, and the two layer definitions.

### Action
Update all occurrences in `api-gateway-stack.ts`:
```typescript
// from
runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X
// to
runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_22_X
```

Also update the two layer `compatibleRuntimes` arrays:
```typescript
compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_22_X]
```

### Python Lambdas — `PYTHON_3_11` (9 functions)
All Python Lambdas use `PYTHON_3_11`. Python 3.11 is still supported on Lambda and not deprecated — no urgent action needed. Python 3.13 is the latest available on Lambda if you want to stay current.

---

## 3. AWS Lambda Powertools Layer

### Problem
The Powertools layer is hard-pinned to version `:78` in `api-gateway-stack.ts`:
```typescript
`arn:aws:lambda:${this.region}:017000801446:layer:AWSLambdaPowertoolsPythonV2:78`
```
The latest release is `v3.27.0`. Pinning to a specific ARN version means you never get bug fixes or security patches automatically.

### Action
Use the SSM public parameter approach so it always resolves to the latest compatible version, or bump the version number manually. To get the latest layer version ARN for your region:

```bash
aws lambda list-layer-versions \
  --layer-name AWSLambdaPowertoolsPythonV2 \
  --region <your-region> \
  --query 'LayerVersions[0].LayerVersionArn' \
  --output text
```

Then update the ARN in `api-gateway-stack.ts`. Alternatively, use the SSM-based lookup which always stays current:
```typescript
const powertoolsLayer = lambda.LayerVersion.fromLayerVersionArn(
  this,
  `${id}-PowertoolsLayer`,
  ssm.StringParameter.valueForStringParameter(
    this,
    `/aws/service/aws-lambda-powertools/python/latest/layer-arn`
  )
);
```

---

## 4. `aws-jwt-verify` Lambda Layer

### Problem
The bundled `aws-jwt-verify` in `cdk/layers/aws-jwt-verify.zip` is version `4.0.0`. The latest is `5.1.1`. This library is used by all three authorizer Lambda functions (`adminAuthorizerFunction`, `studentAuthorizerFunction`, `instructorAuthorizerFunction`).

### Action
Rebuild the layer zip with the latest version:
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/jwt-layer/nodejs
cd /tmp/jwt-layer/nodejs
npm init -y
npm install aws-jwt-verify@5.1.1
cd /tmp/jwt-layer
zip -r aws-jwt-verify.zip nodejs/
cp aws-jwt-verify.zip /path/to/cdk/layers/aws-jwt-verify.zip
```

Then review the [v4 → v5 migration notes](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-jwt-verify/releases) for any breaking changes in the authorizer function code.

---

## 5. `aws-sdk` v2 Deprecation

### CDK (`cdk/package.json`)
`aws-sdk` v2 is in the `dependencies` of the CDK project. Check which CDK lib files use it:
```bash
grep -r "require('aws-sdk')\|from 'aws-sdk'" cdk/lib cdk/bin --include="*.ts"
```
Replace with the equivalent v3 scoped packages (e.g. `@aws-sdk/client-ssm`, `@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager`) and remove `aws-sdk` from `dependencies`.

### Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)
`aws-sdk` v2 is also in the frontend dependencies. The frontend already uses v3 packages (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity`, etc.). Find and remove all v2 usages:
```bash
grep -r "require('aws-sdk')\|from 'aws-sdk'" frontend/src --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"
```
Then remove `aws-sdk` from `frontend/package.json` dependencies entirely.

---

## 6. npm Audit — CDK (`cdk/package.json`)

10 vulnerabilities (3 high, 5 moderate, 2 low). After completing §1, run:
```bash
cd cdk && npm audit fix
```

Key vulnerabilities:

| Package | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `aws-cdk` 2.142–2.148 | Moderate CVE | Fixed by upgrading CLI (§1) |
| `minimatch` | High | ReDoS — `npm audit fix` |
| `picomatch` | High | ReDoS — `npm audit fix` |
| `brace-expansion` | Moderate | ReDoS — `npm audit fix` |
| `diff` | Moderate | DoS — `npm audit fix` |
| `js-yaml` | Moderate | Prototype pollution — `npm audit fix` |
| `yaml` | Moderate | Stack overflow — fixed by upgrading `aws-cdk-lib` to `2.249.0` |
| `ajv` | Moderate | ReDoS — `npm audit fix` |

---

## 7. npm Audit — Frontend (`frontend/package.json`)

**56 vulnerabilities (15 critical, 17 high, 16 moderate, 8 low)** — this is the most urgent area.

The frontend has not had `npm install` run (all packages show as MISSING), so install first:
```bash
cd frontend && npm install
```

Key vulnerabilities requiring attention:

| Package | Severity | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| `axios` ≤1.14.0 | Critical | SSRF, credential leakage, DoS — update to `^1.15.0` |
| `form-data` 4.0.0–4.0.3 | Critical | Unsafe random boundary — `npm audit fix` |
| `fast-xml-parser` | Critical | Entity expansion, regex injection — `npm audit fix` |
| `react-syntax-highlighter` ≤15.6.6 | High | Vulnerability in `prismjs` — update to `^16.1.1` (breaking change) |
| `@remix-run/router` ≤1.23.1 | High | XSS via open redirects — update `react-router-dom` |
| `rollup` 4.0–4.58 | High | Arbitrary file write, XSS — `npm audit fix` |
| `lodash` | High | Prototype pollution — `npm audit fix` |
| `cross-spawn` 7.0.0–7.0.4 | High | ReDoS — `npm audit fix` |
| `node-fetch` <2.6.7 | High | Forwards secure headers to untrusted sites |
| `flatted` | High | Prototype pollution, DoS |

Run after `npm install`:
```bash
cd frontend && npm audit fix
```

## 8. Frontend Package Upgrades (`frontend/package.json`)

### MUI v5 → v9
`@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` are on `^5.x`, latest is `9.0.0`. This is a large jump with breaking changes. Review the [MUI migration guides](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/) for v6, v7, v8, and v9 before upgrading. This affects all components across `pages/admin`, `pages/instructor`, and `pages/student`.

### `material-react-table` v2 → v3
Currently `^2.13.1`, latest is `3.2.1`. Has breaking API changes — review the [v3 migration guide](https://www.material-react-table.com/docs/guides/migrating-to-v3).

### `react-router-dom` v6 → v7
Currently `^6.24.1`, latest is `7.14.0`. v7 has breaking changes around loaders and actions. Also fixes the `@remix-run/router` XSS CVE. Review the [v7 upgrade guide](https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/v6).

### `react-icons` v4 → v5
Currently `^4.9.0`, latest is `5.6.0`. Minor breaking changes in icon naming.

### `@smithy` packages
`@smithy/eventstream-codec`, `@smithy/protocol-http`, `@smithy/signature-v4`, `@smithy/util-utf8` are all on v3/v4 while v4/v5 are available. These should be bumped together as they are part of the same SDK.

### `aws-jwt-verify` (frontend)
Currently `^4.0.1`, latest is `5.1.1`. Update to `^5.1.1`.

### `react-toastify` v10 → v11
Currently `^10.0.5`, latest is `11.0.5`. Minor breaking changes.

### `recharts` v2 → v3
Currently `^2.12.7`, latest is `3.8.1`. Has breaking changes — review changelog before upgrading.

### `eslint` v8 → v9
Currently `^8.57.0`, latest is v9. v9 uses a flat config format — breaking change for `.eslintrc.cjs`.

---

## 9. Python Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

### `langchain-aws` — ✅ `0.2.29` → `1.4.4`
Upgraded in both `text_generation/requirements.txt` and `data_ingestion/requirements.txt`. One breaking change required: `langchain_core.pydantic_v1` was removed in langchain-core 0.3+. Migrated `chat.py` to import `BaseModel` and `Field` directly from `pydantic`. All other APIs (`ChatBedrock`, `BedrockLLM`, `BedrockEmbeddings`, `DynamoDBChatMessageHistory`) remain unchanged.

### ~~`PyPDF2`~~ — ✅ Removed
Removed from all three `requirements.txt` files. Confirmed not imported anywhere in the source code across the full data ingestion pipeline.

### ~~`PyMuPDF`~~ — ✅ Upgraded to `1.25.5`
Upgraded in all three `requirements.txt` files. `1.27.2.2` was attempted but requires C++20 which the Amazon Linux 2 base image (`python:3.11`) does not support. `1.25.5` is the maximum version compatible with the current base image. Further upgrade to `1.27.2.2` is possible when the Lambda base image is upgraded to `python:3.12` or `python:3.13` (Amazon Linux 2023, gcc 11+).

---

## 11. MUI v5 → v6 + `material-react-table` v2 → v3

### Approach
Direct v5 → v9 is too large a jump. Incremental path chosen:
1. **v5 → v6** (done) — minimal breaking changes, MRT v3 requires MUI v6 minimum
2. **MRT v2 → v3** (done) — peer dep bump only, no API changes for this codebase
3. **v6 → v9** (next) — larger jump, deferred to step 11b

### v5 → v6 Breaking Changes Fixed

**Grid API** (5 files): `<Grid item xs={4}>` → `<Grid size={4}>`, `<Grid item>` → `<Grid>`, added `sx={{ width: '100%' }}` to all Grid containers.
- `InstructorNewConcept.jsx`
- `InstructorAnalytics.jsx`
- `InstructorEditConcept.jsx`
- `InstructorNewModule.jsx`
- `InstructorEditCourse.jsx`

**ListItem `button` prop removed** (2 files): Replaced `<ListItem button onClick={...}>` with `<ListItemButton onClick={...}>`.
- `InstructorSidebar.jsx`
- `AdminSidebar.jsx`

**`@mui/x-date-pickers@^7.15.0`** added as a required peer dep for MRT v3 (not used directly in the app).

### v6 → v9 Remaining Work (Step 11b) — ✅ Done

**Additional files fixed during v6→v9:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `StudentHomepage.jsx` | `PaperProps` → `slotProps.paper` on Dialog; `Grid item xs` → `Grid size` |
| `AdminInstructors.jsx` | `PaperProps` → `slotProps.paper` on Dialog |
| `InstructorDetails.jsx` | `MenuProps.PaperProps` → `MenuProps.slotProps.paper`; `Grid item xs` → `Grid size` |
| `CourseDetails.jsx` | `Grid item xs` → `Grid size` |
| `Login.jsx` | All `Grid item xs/sm/md` → `Grid size={{ xs, sm, md }}`; `Grid item xs` (grow) → `Grid size="grow"` |

`@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` final version: `^9.0.0`

**Amplify deploy fix:** `@mui/x-date-pickers` bumped from `^7.29.4` to `^9.0.2` — the v7 release only supports `@mui/material ^5 || ^6 || ^7`, not v9. Also added `frontend/.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` because `material-react-table@3.2.1` declares `@mui/material >= 6` as a peer dep, which npm strict mode rejects against v9. The `.npmrc` ensures Amplify's `npm install` tolerates this (functionally equivalent to `--legacy-peer-deps`).
